# DMOJ Docker - AMAZING THING

This repository contains the Docker files to run a clone of the [DMOJ site](https://github.com/DMOJ/online-judge). It configures some additional services, such as mathoid and texoid.

## Installation

First, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) must be installed. Installation instructions can be found on their respective websites.

Clone the repository:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Ninjaclasher/dmoj-docker
$ cd dmoj-docker
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ cd dmoj
```
From now on, it is assumed you are in the `dmoj` directory.

Initialize the setup by moving the configuration files into the submodule and by creating the necessary directories:
```sh
$ ./scripts/initialize
```

Configure the environment variables in the files in `dmoj/environment/`. In particular, set the MYSQL passwords in `mysql.env` and `mysql-admin.env`, and the host and secret key in `site.env`. Also, configure the `server_name` directive in `dmoj/nginx/conf.d/nginx.conf`.

Next, build the images:
```sh
$ docker-compose build
```

Start up the site, so you can perform the initial migrations and generate the static files:
```sh
$ docker-compose up -d site
```

You will need to generate the schema for the database, since it is currently empty:
```sh
$ ./scripts/migrate
```

You will also need to generate the static files:
```
$ ./scripts/copy_static
```

Finally, the DMOJ comes with fixtures so that the initial install is not blank. They can be loaded with the following commands:
```sh
$ ./scripts/manage.py loaddata navbar
$ ./scripts/manage.py loaddata language_small
$ ./scripts/manage.py loaddata demo
```

## Usage
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

## Notes

### Migrating
As the DMOJ site is a Django app, you may need to migrate whenever you update. Assuming the site container is running, running the following command should suffice:
```sh
$ ./scripts/migrate
```

### Managing Static Files
If your static files ever change, you will need to rebuild them:
```
$ ./scripts/copy_static
```

### Updating The Site
Updating various sections of the site requires different images to be rebuilt.

If any prerequisites were modified, you will need to rebuild most of the images:
```sh
$ docker-compose up -d --build base site celery bridged wsevent
```
If the static files are modified, read the section on [Managing Static Files](#managing-static-files).

If only the source code is modified, a restart is sufficient:
```sh
$ docker-compose restart site celery bridged wsevent
```

### Multiple Nginx Instances

The `docker-compose.yml` configures Nginx to publish to port 80. If you have another Nginx instance on your host machine, you may want to change the port and proxy pass instead.

For example, a possible Nginx configuration file on your host machine would be:
```
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

    add_header X-UA-Compatible "IE=Edge,chrome=1";
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";

    location / {
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:10080/;
    }
}
```

In this case, the port that the Nginx instance in the Docker container is published to would need to be modified to `10080`.
